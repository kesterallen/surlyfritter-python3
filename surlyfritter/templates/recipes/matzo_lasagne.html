  <h1>Matzo Lasagna</h1>
  <p>
    In this browned baked dish, matzo crackers replace the usual pasta for a
    rich, ricotta-filled lasagna that’s Passover-friendly and relatively easy.
    In this version, the ricotta is flecked with basil, and the marinara sauce
    gently spiced with garlic and a touch of red-pepper flakes. Feel free to
    use the recipe as a template to create your own combinations — adding
    vegetables, other herbs and other cheeses as you like. The heady tomato
    sauce and bubbling, golden mozzarella on top can frame whatever other
    ingredients you’d like to add. You can assemble the matzo lasagna the day
    before you bake it (store it in the fridge); just add a few minutes onto
    the baking time. If you are using handmade shmurah matzo, soak the sheets
    for 5 minutes in water before layering them. Supermarket matzo, which is
    lighter and more airy, does not need to be soaked.

  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Heat oven to 375 degrees. </li>
    <li>In a large pot over medium, heat oil, and stir in garlic, anchovies (if using), pepper and red-pepper flakes. </li>
    <li>Cook until garlic starts to brown, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Use your hands to squeeze and crush the whole tomatoes as you add them to the pot, along with any liquid in the cans (or use kitchen shears to cut the tomatoes in the can). </li>
    <li>Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and rosemary sprig, bring to a gentle simmer, and simmer at medium-low heat for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread generous 1/2 cup sauce on the bottom of a 9-by-13 baking dish. </li>
    <li>Place matzo crackers in an even layer on top, breaking crackers to fit as necessary.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir together ricotta, egg, basil, pepper, remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and nutmeg.</li>
    <li>Spread half the ricotta mixture over the matzo layer, spreading all the way to the edges. Top with generous 3/4 cup tomato sauce, then scatter with 1/3 of the mozzarella.</li>
    <li>Repeat matzo, ricotta, tomato sauce, and mozzarella layers.</li>
    <li>Top with a final layer of matzo, then spread remaining tomato sauce (about 2 cups) on top, making sure all of the matzo is covered. Top with remaining mozzarella and 1/2 cup Parmesan.</li>
    <li>Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake until cheese is golden and sauce is bubbly, about 20 to 25 minutes longer. </li>
    <li>Remove from oven and let cool for 5 to 10 minutes, then serve topped with more basil, a drizzle of olive oil and more red-pepper flakes, if you like.</li>
  </ul>
